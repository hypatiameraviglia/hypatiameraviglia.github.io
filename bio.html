	<p> Hypatia Meraviglia is a planetary systems scientist working on a PhD in geoscience at Arizona State University in sunny Tempe. 
	They specialize in the Saturnian moons (Titan and Enceladus) and ices in the outer Solar System.
	</p>
	<p>Meraviglia is currently working on a PhD in geosciences in Sara Imari Walker's <a href="http://emergence.asu.edu/" target="_blank">ELIFE lab</a> at Arizona State University, supported in part by the National Science Foundation's <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank">Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.
	<h2><b>Education</b></h2>
	<p>In 2023, they graduated magna cum laude from the University of Central Arkansas with a B.A. in linguistics and a B.S. in physics. 
	In 2019, they graduated summa cum laude from the University of Arkansas at Hope-Texarkana with an A.A. in general studies, which they earned in high school.</p>
	<h2><b>Research</b></h2>
	<p>Meraviglia's primary research question is how the different systems of a planetary body (atmospheric chemistry, surface processes, geologic processes, and sometimes subsurface oceanic processes) interlock to produce the complex nevironmental systems we observe.
